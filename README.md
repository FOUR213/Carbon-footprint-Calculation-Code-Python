# Carbon-footprint-Calculation-Code-Python
This Python project provides a simple terminal based carbon footprint quiz with two modes: a fast 10 question assessment and a detailed 30 question version. It calculates a weighted score based on user responses and categorizes the result into low, moderate, or high carbon footprint. No external libraries are required.
